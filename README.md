0x16. C - Simple Shell
- A group project with Vishay Singh and Gabriela da Silva

In this project we have Created a simple shell which should:
- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
- The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
- Handle errors.
- Handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D).

Simple shell 0.1 + should:
- Handle command lines with arguments.

Simple shell 0.2 + should:
- Handle the PATH.
- fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist.

Simple shell 0.3 + should:
- Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell.
- Usage: exit.
- You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit.

Simple shell 0.4 + should:
- Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment.
- Extra Line
